Welcome to Part 3 of the FooBook_Android project. This phase brings critical updates to the app, integrating MongoDB for backend storage and Room for local database management. We've also incorporated JWT for secure authentication, enhanced UI components, and introduced a complete friend system, alongside other robust features.

## Getting Started
To get started with these new features, please follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the latest version of Android Studio.

To fully utilize the functionalities of FooBook_Android, it's essential to have the Foobook_Server
operational,since this frontend application depends on its API endpoints for data access.
Verify that your MongoDB Atlas cluster is active and accessible.
Update the Android SDK to the latest available version.

### Installation
